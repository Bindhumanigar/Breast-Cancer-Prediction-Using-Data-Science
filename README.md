# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Data Science

## Project Overview
Breast cancer prediction aims to assist in early diagnosis and treatment by using machine learning algorithms to classify breast tumours as benign or malignant. This project involves preprocessing medical data, selecting relevant features, training predictive models, and evaluating their performance to achieve high accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilize datasets like the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset with features from digitized breast mass images.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, normalize features, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Feature Selection/Extraction**: Use techniques like PCA, RFE, and correlation analysis to select the most relevant features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess models with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to select the best one.
- **Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly web application for clinicians to input data and receive predictions.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset using libraries like pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Normalize and encode features, and split data into training and testing sets.
3. **Feature Selection**: Apply feature selection methods to identify key features.
4. **Model Training**: Train and optimize various machine learning models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics to determine the best-performing model.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
